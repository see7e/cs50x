We can characterize their audio aura based on the average values. The average energy is 0.65906, the
average valence is 0.484443, and the average danceability is 0.71646. This indicates that the
listener's top songs have moderate energy, tend to be less positive in valence, and are generally
danceable.

However, there are limitations to this calculation that may affect its representativeness of the
listener's actual preferences. Firstly, it only considers a sample size of 100 songs from a single
year, not accounting for the listener's full music history or changes in their preferences over time.
Additionally, the calculation overlooks the diversity of genres and individual song preferences
within the listener's top songs. It also fails to consider the emotional significance or connection
the listener may have with specific songs.

To improve the calculation of the audio aura, alternative approaches can be considered. Weighted
averages can be used, giving more weight to songs with higher play counts or personal ratings. Time
weighting can also be applied, considering the recency of songs to capture the listener's current
mood and preferences. Including user input, such as rating songs based on emotional impact or
categorizing songs into mood categories, can further personalize the audio aura calculation.
Analyzing the listener's top songs within different genres separately can also provide a more detailed
representation of their musical tastes.
