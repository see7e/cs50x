# [Week 1 Practice Problems](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/1/#week-1-practice-problems#week-1-practice-problems)

These problems assume that you have already set up your CS50 Codespace in [Lab 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/1/#week-1-practice-problems../../labs/1/). Be sure to complete that before attempting these problems.

In addition to this week’s lab and problem set, you’re welcome to try any of these (optional!) practice problems:

-   [Debug](./debug.md) [#](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/1/#week-1-practice-problemsdebug/), for becoming familiar with C syntax and debugging programs
-   [Half](./half.md) [#](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/1/#week-1-practice-problemshalf/), for practice creating a function
-   [Prime](./prime.md) [#](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/1/#week-1-practice-problemsprime/), for practice using `for` loops
