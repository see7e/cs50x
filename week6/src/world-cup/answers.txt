Times:

10 simulations: 0m0,030s
100 simulations: 0m0,104s
1000 simulations: 0m0,038s
10000 simulations: 0m0,097s
100000 simulations: 0m0,723s
1000000 simulations: 0m7,225s

Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

That the time required wuold be constant if the only thing that supposedly changed was the number of iterations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100000 simulations
