# Hello

Implement a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user, per the below.

```bash
$ python hello.py
What is your name?
David
hello, David
```

## Getting Started [#](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/6/hello//#getting-started)

Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

```bash
$
```

Next execute

```bash
wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/psets/6/sentimental-hello.zip
```

in order to download a ZIP called `sentimental-hello.zip` into your codespace.

Then execute

```bash
unzip sentimental-hello.zip
```

to create a folder called `sentimental-hello`. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

```bash
rm sentimental-hello.zip
```

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

```bash
cd sentimental-hello
```

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

```bash
sentimental-hello/ $
```

Execute `ls` by itself, and you should see `hello.py`. If you run into any trouble, follow these same steps again and see if you can determine where you went wrong!

## Specification

Write, in a file called `hello.py`, a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name, exactly as you did in [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/6/hello/../../1/), except that your program this time should be written in Python.

## Usage

Your program should behave per the example below.

```bash
$ python hello.py
What is your name?
Emma
hello, Emma
```

## Testing

While `check50` is available for this problem, you’re encouraged to first test your code on your own for each of the following.

-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `David` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, David`.
-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Bernie` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Bernie`.
-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Carter` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Carter`.

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`. But be sure to compile and test it yourself as well!

```bash
check50 cs50/problems/2023/x/sentimental/hello
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```bash
style50 hello.py
```

## How to Submit

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```bash
submit50 cs50/problems/2023/x/sentimental/hello
```
